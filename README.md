------
The system follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, 
separating business logic (Models), HTTP request handling (Controllers), and presentation, which promotes scalability, testability, and maintainability. 

Interfaces play a critical role in defining consistent contracts between components (e.g., service layers, repositories), facilitating loose coupling, 
and seamless integration of future enhancements. 

The application operates database triggers to automatically log historical price changes whenever a productâ€™s price is updated, 
ensuring an audit trail for data transparency and compliance. 

Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are utilized to decouple the internal domain model from the API layer, 
enabling controlled data exposure, validation, and optimized payloads for client interactions. 

For security, user passwords are hashed using robust algorithms before storage, 
ensuring sensitive credentials remain protected even in the event of a database breach. 
Together, these practices ensure a secure, modular, and maintainable codebase aligned with industry standards.
